To get started you must follow or have the following ready. Click on the links for instructions on how to perform some of these tasks. To learn how to create a fork in GitHub online the links are included below. Just know that you do not need to install Git command line or desktop edition. Only follow the instructions in that document in the "Forking a Repository" section and ignore the Prerequisites. You only need an active GitHub account.

- A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of [the CIPP GitHub](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP) repository.
- A [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of [the CIPP API GitHub](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP-API) repository.
- An active Azure Subscription.
- A GitHub Personal Access Token. You can find instructions on what you need and the minimum permissions to do this [in Microsoft's Azure Static Web Apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-azure-resource-manager?tabs=azure-cli#create-a-github-personal-access-token). You only need the "Create a GitHub Personal Access Token" section. You can leave the default of 30 days for the expiry of the token. It is only used once during the authentication process.

For the installation and maintenance, it's assumed you have some knowledge of GitHub. Using the latest version of CIPP, you do not need to execute the Secure Application Model Script beforehand. If you have your own Secure Application Model setup you'll be able to enter these keys after setup.
